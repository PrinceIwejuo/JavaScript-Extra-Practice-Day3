- the variable count is availble in the counterMaker function.

- count is initialized with a let rather than a var or const in order to allow the variable "count" to be changed.
// Explain how initalizing the variable 'count' with a var would change it's scope
- the var statement declares a functionscoped or globally scoped variable, optionall initilizing it to a value. could become very messy!

TASK 4 ðŸš€
/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.
  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.  
  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.
  
  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
